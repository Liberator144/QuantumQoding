# Frontend TypeScript and Design System Integration Best Practices - 2023-11-15

## TypeScript Implementation

- **Use comprehensive interfaces** for all data structures to ensure type safety across the application
- **Create dedicated type files** for each domain area (quantum, consciousness, neural, dimensional)
- **Extend third-party library types** (like d3.js) to provide better type safety and autocompletion
- **Configure strict TypeScript settings** in tsconfig.json to catch potential issues early
- **Use path aliases** for cleaner imports and better organization
- **Add JSDoc comments** to interfaces and functions for better documentation

## State Management

- **Use Zustand** for quantum-coherent state management with proper TypeScript integration
- **Implement persistence middleware** for settings and authentication state
- **Separate stores by domain** (auth, settings, UI, quantum) for better organization
- **Include action functions within store definitions** for encapsulated state management
- **Use getState()** for accessing store state outside of React components
- **Implement proper error handling** in async store actions

## Frontend Screen Design

- **Create consistent layouts** across different screen types
- **Implement proper navigation** between related screens (star system to feature)
- **Use motion animations** for transitions between states
- **Include proper error states** when data is not available
- **Implement responsive designs** that work across device sizes
- **Add accessibility attributes** to all interactive elements

## Design System Integration

- **Create a theme provider** that supports both light and dark modes
- **Detect system preferences** for initial theme selection
- **Implement quantum-themed components** with appropriate animations
- **Use consistent spacing and typography** across all components
- **Create reusable atomic components** that can be composed into more complex UIs
- **Add quantum effects** to interactive elements for visual feedback
