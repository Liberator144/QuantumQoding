# Contributing to QQ-Verse Backend

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the QQ-Verse Backend! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to foster an inclusive and respectful community.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/QQ-Verse-backend.git
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/QuantumQoding/QQ-Verse-backend.git
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Environment

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as needed
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Coding Standards

We follow these coding standards:

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the ESLint configuration
- Write comprehensive tests for new features
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Follow the existing project structure

## Pull Request Process

1. Update your fork with the latest upstream changes:
   ```
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. Ensure your code passes all tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```
3. Ensure your code passes linting:
   ```
   npm run lint
   ```
4. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Create a pull request from your branch to the upstream main branch
6. Fill out the pull request template with all required information
7. Wait for code review and address any feedback

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(auth): add quantum authentication support
```

## Testing

All new features should include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for individual functions and components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows

Run tests with:
```
npm test
```

## Documentation

- Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Update the README.md when adding new features
- Add examples for complex functionality
- Document environment variables in .env.example

## Quantum Coherence Guidelines

When working with quantum-related features:

1. Maintain quantum coherence across dimensional boundaries
2. Ensure proper entanglement of quantum states
3. Implement appropriate decoherence protection
4. Document quantum algorithms thoroughly
5. Test quantum features with appropriate simulations

## Neural Fabric Guidelines

When working with neural fabric features:

1. Maintain neural pathway integrity
2. Document node connection patterns
3. Implement appropriate activation functions
4. Test neural fabric with consciousness stream simulations
5. Ensure proper quantum integration

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need help, please:

1. Check the existing issues
2. Create a new issue with the "question" label
3. Reach out to the maintainers

Thank you for contributing to the QQ-Verse Backend!
