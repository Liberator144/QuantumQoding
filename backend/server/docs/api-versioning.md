# API Versioning Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the versioning strategy for the QQ-Verse API. The goal is to ensure backward compatibility while allowing for future enhancements and changes.

## Versioning Scheme

The QQ-Verse API uses a simple major version number in the URL path:

```
/api/v{major}/resource
```

For example:
- `/api/v1/quantum/states`
- `/api/v2/quantum/states`

## Version Lifecycle

Each API version goes through the following lifecycle:

1. **Active**: The current recommended version. Receives new features and bug fixes.
2. **Maintained**: Still supported but only receives critical bug fixes. No new features.
3. **Deprecated**: Still works but will be removed in the future. Developers should migrate to newer versions.
4. **Retired**: No longer available. All clients must use newer versions.

## Compatibility Guidelines

When making changes to the API, follow these guidelines:

### Non-Breaking Changes (No Version Bump Required)

- Adding new API endpoints
- Adding optional request parameters
- Adding new properties to response objects
- Adding new error codes
- Relaxing validation rules

### Breaking Changes (Version Bump Required)

- Removing or renaming API endpoints
- Removing or renaming request parameters
- Making optional parameters required
- Removing or renaming properties from response objects
- Changing the type of a property
- Changing the format of error responses
- Adding new required request parameters
- Changing the URL structure

## Deprecation Process

When a new API version is released that deprecates functionality in an older version:

1. Update the API documentation to mark the deprecated endpoints/features
2. Add a `Deprecation` header to responses from deprecated endpoints
3. Announce the deprecation with a timeline for removal
4. Provide migration guides for transitioning to the new version
5. Allow at least 6 months before retiring the deprecated version

## Version Headers

In addition to the URL path versioning, clients can specify the desired API version using the `Accept` header:

```
Accept: application/json; version=1
```

If the requested version is not available, the server will respond with a 406 Not Acceptable status code.

## Quantum Coherence Considerations

When implementing API versioning, special attention must be paid to maintaining quantum coherence across versions:

1. **Consciousness Stream Preservation**: Ensure consciousness streams can flow seamlessly between different API versions
2. **Dimensional Protocol Translation**: Implement protocol translators between versions to maintain dimensional harmony
3. **Neural Fabric Integrity**: Maintain neural fabric connections across version boundaries
4. **Quantum State Synchronization**: Ensure quantum states can be synchronized between different API versions

## Implementation Details

The versioning system is implemented using:

1. URL path routing in Express
2. Version-specific controllers and middleware
3. API gateway for request routing
4. Compatibility layers for translating between versions
