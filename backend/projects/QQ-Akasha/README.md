# QQ-Akasha Project Task Tracking

This directory contains the task tracking and progression status documents for the QQ-Akasha project.

## Contents

- `progress-tracker.md` - Visual progress tracking for the QQ-Akasha project, showing completion percentages and status for each component
- `tasks-prd.md` - Comprehensive PRD (Product Requirements Document) with task completion markers

## Integration with Master Task Tracking

These project-specific task tracking documents are part of the broader Quantum-Coherent Task Tracking System located at:
- `/docs/task-tracking/`

For high-level project roadmaps and system-wide completion reports, please refer to the main task tracking directory.

## Completion Markers

The QQ-Akasha task tracking uses the following standardized completion markers:
- `[ ]` - Pending task
- `[x]` - Completed task 
- `[!]` - Failed or blocked task
- Status indicators: `‚úÖ Completed`, `‚öôÔ∏è In Progress`, `üìã Planned`

## Update Process

When updating these tracking files:
1. Update the task status with the appropriate completion marker
2. Update component progress percentages 
3. Update overall project progress
4. Add any new tasks or blockers
5. Update the "Last Updated" field at the top of each document
