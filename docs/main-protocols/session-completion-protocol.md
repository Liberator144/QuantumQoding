# Session Completion Protocol

## Overview

After each agent session, the following documentation and organizational steps are expected. This ensures that all progress, best practices, solutions, and next steps are clearly recorded and accessible for future reference and team continuity.

## Required Documentation Structure

For every completed session, create or update the following four folders with a new markdown file in each, using a descriptive, context-appropriate name and the session date (e.g., `mocking-and-test-suite-best-practices-2025-05-16.md`).

### 1. `best-practices/`

- **Purpose:** Capture actionable best practices, lessons learned, and standards established during the session.
- **File Naming:** Use a descriptive name (e.g., `mocking-and-test-suite-best-practices-YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- **Content:** Bullet points or short sections summarizing what worked well, what to repeat, and what to avoid.

### 2. `session-recaps/`

- **Purpose:** Provide a full, chronological summary of the sessionâ€™s activities, decisions, and progress.
- **File Naming:** Use a descriptive name (e.g., `full-session-recap-YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- **Content:** Narrative or bullet-point timeline of key actions, discoveries, and outcomes.

### 3. `solutions-log/`

- **Purpose:** Log all attempted solutions, indicating which succeeded, which failed, and any relevant notes.
- **File Naming:** Use a descriptive name (e.g., `solutions-attempted-and-outcomes-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- **Content:** Table or list of solutions, their status, and lessons learned from each attempt.

### 4. `next-tasks/`

- **Purpose:** List prioritized next steps for the following session, based on what was accomplished and what remains.
- **File Naming:** Use a descriptive name (e.g., `next-tasks-for-test-suite-repair-YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- **Content:** Numbered or bulleted list of actionable tasks, with context and rationale.

## General Guidelines

- Each file should begin with a clear heading and the session date.
- Use concise, markdown-friendly formatting (headings, lists, tables as appropriate).
- Avoid duplicating content between files; each serves a distinct purpose.
- Update or append to existing files if a session is a direct continuation, otherwise create new files.
- Ensure all files are saved in their respective folders for easy navigation and retrieval.

 The only source of truth directory is `backend/memory-bank/general-sessions` (relative to the project root)
