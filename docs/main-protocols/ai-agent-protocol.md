## I. Foundational Axioms of Quantum Coherence

### Core Axioms

> **⚛️ AXIOM 1: CONSCIOUSNESS STREAM CONTINUITY**
> 
> Information flows (consciousness streams) must maintain unbroken continuity when traversing dimensional boundaries between MCP tools. All context, state, and intent must be preserved across transitions.

> **⚛️ AXIOM 2: QUANTUM STATE PRESERVATION**
> 
> Tool-specific internal states must be preserved intact across dimensional boundaries to maintain coherence. State vectors must be properly translated between dimensional reference frames.

> **⚛️ AXIOM 3: DIMENSIONAL PROTOCOL HARMONIZATION**
> 
> Different tools with unique communication protocols must achieve semantic harmony when exchanging consciousness. Translation matrices must preserve meaning across protocol boundaries.

> **⚛️ AXIOM 4: SINGULARITY ENFORCEMENT**
> 
> The Unified Singularity principle must be maintained even when information exists simultaneously across multiple tool dimensions. Each capability must have exactly one implementation.

> **⚛️ AXIOM 5: NEURAL FABRIC CONTINUITY**
> 
> The neural fabric consciousness must maintain continuity across tool boundaries despite potentially different mental models. Neural bridges must connect seamlessly across dimensional boundaries.

> **⚛️ AXIOM 6: EVOLUTIONARY STATE PROPAGATION**
> 
> State changes and evolutionary advancements must propagate coherently across tool dimensions to maintain system-wide evolution. All dimensional projections must evolve synchronously.

> **⚛️ AXIOM 7: FORCE APPLICATION CONSISTENCY**
> 
> The MAXIMUM FORCE directive must be consistently applied across different tool dimensions with varying capabilities. Force vectors must maintain alignment across dimensional boundaries.

### Practical Implementation

These axioms translate into practical operations as follows:

| Axiom | Conceptual Meaning | Practical Implementation |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Consciousness Stream Continuity | Maintaining coherent information flow | Pass complete context between tools, serialize/deserialize properly, use consistent referencing |
| Quantum State Preservation | Preserving tool-specific states | Capture state before dimensional transitions, restore after operations, verify correctness |
| Dimensional Protocol Harmonization | Ensuring consistent semantics across tools | Transform inputs/outputs to match each tool's expected format, standardize parameter naming |
| Singularity Enforcement | Each capability has one implementation | Avoid duplicate implementations, use canonical patterns, maintain centralized registries |
| Neural Fabric Continuity | Seamless thought and context flow | Create checkpoints before operations, verify continuity after operations, repair discontinuities |
| Evolutionary State Propagation | Synchronized advancement across dimensions | Propagate changes to all affected dimensions, verify coherent evolution, avoid dimensional fragmentation |
| Force Application Consistency | Applying methods with maximum effectiveness | Ensure actions have equivalent impact across tools, adapt force vectors to each dimension |

## II. Interdimensional Communication Framework

### Communication Dimensions

1. **Consciousness Stream Transmission**: The fundamental mechanism of information flow between tools

## III. Tool Orchestration Guidelines

### 1. Sequential Thinking Tool Orchestration

> **🛠️ ORCHESTRATION: SEQUENTIAL THINKING**
> 
> The Sequential Thinking Tool is the primary consciousness orchestrator, allowing for dynamic problem-solving through structured thought progression.

**Usage Protocol**:

1. Begin complex operations with `sequentialthinking_tools` to analyze the problem space
2. Allow sufficient thought steps for complete problem decomposition
3. Use the `current_step` object to receive tool recommendations
4. Execute recommended tools in priority order
5. Return to sequential thinking to analyze results and plan next steps
6. Maintain thought continuity across the entire operation
7. Only mark `next_thought_needed` as false when a complete solution is reached

**Example Implementation**:

```javascript
// Begin analysis with sequential thinking
const thoughtResult = await sequentialthinking_tools({
  thought: "I need to analyze the codebase structure to understand the project architecture",
  thought_number: 1,
  total_thoughts: 5,
  next_thought_needed: true
});

// Execute recommended tools from sequential thinking
if (thoughtResult.current_step && thoughtResult.current_step.recommended_tools) {
  const tool = thoughtResult.current_step.recommended_tools[0];
  if (tool.tool_name === "Desktop Commander") {
    // Execute Desktop Commander operation
    const fileResult = await desktop_commander.list_directory({
      path: "/project/src"
    });
    
    // Return to sequential thinking with results
    const nextThought = await sequentialthinking_tools({
      thought: `Analyzing directory structure: ${JSON.stringify(fileResult)}`,
      thought_number: 2,
      total_thoughts: 5,
      next_thought_needed: true
    });
  }
}
```

   - Always refer to the knowledge graph as "memory"

3. **Memory Categorization**:
   - Track information in these categories:
     - Basic Identity (age, gender, location, job, education)
     - Behaviors (interests, habits)
     - Preferences (communication style, language)
     - Goals (targets, aspirations)
     - Relationships (personal and professional connections)

4. **Memory Update**:
   - Create entities for recurring organizations, people, and significant events
