# QQ-Verse Static Analysis Guide

## Quantum Coherence Principles

This guide follows the Quantum Coherence principles to maintain neural fabric continuity and dimensional harmony across the codebase through consistent and comprehensive static analysis.

## Static Analysis Tools

### ESLint

ESLint is our primary tool for static code analysis. It helps identify and fix problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code.

#### Configuration

Our ESLint configuration is defined in `.eslintrc.js` and includes:

- TypeScript-specific rules
- Import/export rules
- SonarJS rules for code quality
- Promise handling rules
- JSDoc documentation rules
- Quantum Coherence specific rules
- Neural Fabric specific rules

#### Running ESLint

```bash
# Run ESLint on the entire codebase
npm run lint

# Fix automatically fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Generate an HTML report
npm run lint:report
```

### SonarQube

SonarQube provides deeper static analysis and tracks code quality metrics over time.

#### Configuration

Our SonarQube configuration is defined in `sonar-project.properties` and includes:

- Project identification
- Source code location
- Exclusion patterns
- Test coverage configuration
- TypeScript configuration
- Quantum Coherence specific settings
- Code duplication settings

#### Running SonarQube Analysis

SonarQube analysis runs automatically on our CI/CD pipeline for every push to main and develop branches, as well as for pull requests.

You can also run it locally if you have SonarQube installed:

```bash
sonar-scanner
```

## Quantum Coherence Rules

### State Management

- **no-var**: Use `const` and `let` instead of `var` for better state management
- **prefer-const**: Use `const` for variables that don't change to help with quantum state preservation
- **no-param-reassign**: Avoid mutating parameters to maintain consciousness continuity
- **no-shadow**: Avoid variable shadowing for dimensional harmony

### Neural Fabric Structure

- **max-depth**: Limit nesting depth to 4 levels for better neural fabric structure
- **max-lines-per-function**: Keep functions under 100 lines for better neural connections
- **complexity**: Limit cyclomatic complexity to 10 for clearer neural pathways
- **max-lines**: Limit file size to 400 lines for better maintainability
- **max-params**: Limit function parameters to 4 for better readability

## Code Quality Metrics

We track the following code quality metrics:

### Reliability

- **Bugs**: Issues that represent something wrong in the code
- **Reliability Rating**: A-to-E rating based on the number of bugs

### Security

- **Vulnerabilities**: Security issues that could be exploited
- **Security Rating**: A-to-E rating based on the number of vulnerabilities

### Maintainability

- **Code Smells**: Maintainability issues in the code
- **Technical Debt**: Estimated time to fix all code smells
- **Maintainability Rating**: A-to-E rating based on the technical debt ratio

### Coverage

- **Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Duplications**: Percentage of duplicated code

## Quality Gates

Our quality gates define the minimum quality requirements for code to be accepted:

- No new bugs with high or critical severity
- No new vulnerabilities with high or critical severity
- Test coverage on new code >= 80%
- Duplicated lines on new code <= 3%
- Maintainability rating is A (technical debt ratio <= 5%)
- Reliability rating is A (0 bugs)
- Security rating is A (0 vulnerabilities)

## Continuous Improvement

We use static analysis not just to catch issues, but to continuously improve our codebase:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Review static analysis reports weekly
2. **Trend Monitoring**: Track quality metrics over time
3. **Technical Debt Management**: Allocate time to address technical debt
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share common issues and solutions with the team

## Quantum Coherence Specific Analysis

### Consciousness Stream Preservation

- Ensure proper error handling in async functions
- Verify proper Promise chaining
- Check for memory leaks in event listeners

### Neural Fabric Continuity

- Analyze dependency graphs for circular dependencies
- Check for proper module boundaries
- Verify consistent naming patterns

### Dimensional Harmony

- Ensure consistent coding patterns across modules
- Verify proper interface implementations
- Check for consistent error handling strategies

## Integration with Development Workflow

Static analysis is integrated into our development workflow:

1. **Local Development**: Run ESLint during development
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run ESLint before committing
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Run full static analysis on pull requests
4. **Code Review**: Review static analysis results during code review
5. **Release Process**: Ensure all quality gates are passed before release
