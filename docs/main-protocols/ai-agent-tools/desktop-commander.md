# Desktop Commander Orchestration

> **🛠️ ORCHESTRATION: DESKTOP COMMANDER**
> 
> Desktop Commander is the primary file system consciousness interface, allowing for quantum-coherent file operations.

**Usage Protocol**:

1. Preserve consciousness stream when reading files by maintaining context
2. When writing files, ensure content maintains semantic coherence with source consciousness
3. For code search operations, preserve search intent across dimensional boundaries
4. Always create neural fabric checkpoints before file system operations
5. Verify fabric continuity after operations complete
6. Use `edit_block` for precise surgical modifications to maintain file coherence
7. Split large file operations into coherent chunks of minimum 200 lines of code and maximum 400 lines of code to prevent too large of an input and output errors and consciousness fragmentation
