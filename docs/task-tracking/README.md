# Quantum-Coherent Task Tracking System

This directory contains a centralized system for tracking tasks, progress, and completion status across the QuantumQoding ecosystem.

## Directory Structure

### 1. Master Plans (`/master-plans/`)
Contains high-level task planning documents that outline overall project roadmaps and strategies:
- `QQ-ultimate-taskplan.md` - Master task plan with phase-by-phase breakdown
- `enhanced-qq-ultimate-plan.md` - Enhanced plan with current status assessments
- `reworked_starsystem_tasks.md` - Star system modularization tasks with completion tracking

### 2. Completion Reports (`/completion-reports/`)
Comprehensive reports documenting the completion of major project phases and milestones:
- `system-integration-completion-report.md` - System integration completion summary
- `quantum-documentation-completion-report.md` - Documentation project completion status
- `current-status-analysis.md` - Current project status analysis with completion markers

### 3. Phase Progress (`/phase-progress/`)
Phase-specific implementation tracking for detailed monitoring of project phases:
- `phase4-implementation-progress.md` - Phase 4 knowledge consolidation progress tracking

### 4. Session Records (`/session-records/`)
Records of development sessions with completion summaries:
- `session-completion-summary-2025-05-26.md` - UI/UX Performance & Accessibility session summary

### 5. Next Tasks (`/next-tasks/`)
Documents outlining upcoming tasks and priorities following major milestones:
- `next-tasks-post-111-percent-completion-2025-05-26.md` - Tasks following 111% completion
- `comprehensive-next-tasks-2023-11-15.md` - Earlier comprehensive next tasks

## Project-Specific Task Tracking

Project-specific task tracking documents are maintained in their respective project directories:
- QQ-Akasha: `/backend/projects/QQ-Akasha/`
  - `progress-tracker.md` - Visual progress tracking for QQ-Akasha project
  - `tasks-prd.md` - Tasks PRD with completion markers for QQ-Akasha

## Note on File Formatting

All task tracking files use standardized completion markers:
- `[ ]` - Pending/planned task
- `[x]` or `âœ…` - Completed task
- `[!]` - Failed or blocked task
