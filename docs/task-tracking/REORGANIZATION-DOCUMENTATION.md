# Task Tracking Reorganization Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the reorganization of task-related markdown files in the QuantumQoding codebase, focusing on documents that contain completion markers and progression status. This reorganization was implemented on May 30, 2025, to create a more coherent structure for task tracking while preserving guides, tutorials, protocols, and other documentation in their original locations.

## Reorganization Strategy

The reorganization established two primary locations for task-tracking documents:

1. **Centralized Task Tracking Hub**: `/docs/task-tracking/` - A new top-level directory containing all general task planning, tracking, and completion documentation.
2. **Project-Specific Task Tracking**: `/backend/projects/{project-name}/` - Project-specific tracking within the backend directory structure.

## File Relocations

### Master Task Plans
- `/docs/tasks-protocol/QQ-ultimate-taskplan.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/master-plans/QQ-ultimate-taskplan.md`
- `/docs/tasks-protocol/enhanced-qq-ultimate-plan.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/master-plans/enhanced-qq-ultimate-plan.md`
- `/docs/tasks-protocol/reworked_starsystem_tasks.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/master-plans/reworked_starsystem_tasks.md`

### Completion Reports
- `/docs/SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/completion-reports/system-integration-completion-report.md`
- `/docs/QUANTUM-DOCUMENTATION-COMPLETION-REPORT.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/completion-reports/quantum-documentation-completion-report.md`
- `/docs/CURRENT-STATUS-ANALYSIS.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/completion-reports/current-status-analysis.md`

### Phase Progress Tracking
- `/docs/phase4-knowledge-consolidation/implementation-progress.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/phase-progress/phase4-implementation-progress.md`

### Session Records and Next Tasks
- `/backend/memory-bank/general-sessions/session-completion-summary-2025-05-26.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/session-records/session-completion-summary-2025-05-26.md`
- `/backend/memory-bank/general-sessions/next-tasks/next-tasks-post-111-percent-completion-2025-05-26.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/next-tasks/next-tasks-post-111-percent-completion-2025-05-26.md`
- `/backend/memory-bank/general-sessions/next-tasks/comprehensive-next-tasks-2023-11-15.md` → `/docs/task-tracking/next-tasks/comprehensive-next-tasks-2023-11-15.md`

### Project-Specific Task Tracking
- `/backend/starmenu/QQ-Akasha/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` → `/backend/projects/QQ-Akasha/progress-tracker.md`
- `/backend/starmenu/QQ-Akasha/QQ_AKASHA_TASKS_PRD.md` → `/backend/projects/QQ-Akasha/tasks-prd.md`

## Unchanged Files

The following files were kept in their original locations as they serve specific purposes within their current directories:

- `/docs/architecture/quantum-documentation-revolution-summary.md` - Part of the architecture documentation
- `/frontend/src/utils/phase1-execution-report.ts` - Active code file for phase 1 tracking, not documentation

## New Index Files

The reorganization included the creation of several index files to improve navigation:

1. `/docs/task-tracking/README.md` - Documents the structure of the central task tracking system
2. `/docs/task-tracking/MASTER-INDEX.md` - Comprehensive index of all task-related documentation
3. `/backend/projects/QQ-Akasha/README.md` - Project-specific task tracking documentation

## Benefits of Reorganization

This reorganization provides several benefits:

1. **Centralized Task Tracking**: All high-level task planning and completion documentation is now in one location
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Task-tracking documents are now separate from other documentation types
3. **Improved Navigation**: New index files make it easier to find relevant task documentation
4. **Project-Specific Organization**: Project-specific task tracking is now organized within a unified project structure
5. **Preserved Context**: The reorganization maintains the relationships between different types of task documentation

## Next Steps

To fully complete the integration of this reorganization:

1. Update any documents that reference the moved files
2. Consider adding links in original locations pointing to new locations
3. Establish procedures for creating new task-tracking documents in the appropriate locations
