# QQ-Verse Git Workflow

This document outlines the Git workflow, branching strategy, pull request process, and code review guidelines for the QQ-Verse project.

## Branching Strategy

QQ-Verse follows a modified Git Flow branching strategy to maintain a clean and organized repository.

### Main Branches

- **main**: The production branch containing stable, released code
- **develop**: The integration branch for features in development

### Supporting Branches

- **feature/**: For new features and non-emergency bug fixes
- **bugfix/**: For fixes to issues in unreleased code
- **hotfix/**: For urgent fixes to production code
- **release/**: For preparing releases
- **docs/**: For documentation updates only
- **refactor/**: For code refactoring without changing functionality

### Branch Naming Convention

Branches should follow this naming convention:

```
<branch-type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feature/42-quantum-particle-effects`
- `bugfix/57-fix-navigation-crash`
- `hotfix/63-critical-auth-vulnerability`
- `docs/78-update-installation-guide`
- `refactor/91-optimize-star-rendering`

### Branch Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Create branches from the appropriate base branch
   - `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`: branch from `develop`
   - `hotfix/`: branch from `main`
   - `release/`: branch from `develop`

2. **Integration**: Merge branches back to their source
   - `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`: merge to `develop` via PR
   - `hotfix/`: merge to both `main` and `develop` via PR
   - `release/`: merge to both `main` and `develop` via PR

3. **Cleanup**: Delete branches after successful merge

## Pull Request Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Prepare Your Branch**
   - Ensure your branch is up to date with its base branch
   - Run tests locally to verify your changes work
   - Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages

2. **Submit the Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template provided in the repository
   - Include a clear title that summarizes the change
   - Provide a detailed description of the changes
   - Link to any related issues
   - Assign appropriate reviewers
   - Add relevant labels

3. **PR Template**

   ```markdown
   ## Description
   [Provide a brief description of the changes in this PR]

   ## Related Issues
   [Link to any related issues, e.g., "Fixes #42"]

   ## Type of Change
   - [ ] New feature
   - [ ] Bug fix
   - [ ] Documentation update
   - [ ] Code refactoring
   - [ ] Performance improvement
   - [ ] Build/deployment configuration change

   ## Testing Performed
   [Describe the testing you've done to verify your changes]

   ## Screenshots (if applicable)
   [Add screenshots to help explain your changes]

   ## Checklist
   - [ ] My code follows the project's style guidelines
   - [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code
   - [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
   - [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly
   - [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
   - [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
   - [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
   ```

### PR Review and Merge Process

1. **Automated Checks**
   - CI/CD pipeline runs automated tests
   - Linting and code style checks are performed
   - All checks must pass before merging

2. **Code Review**
   - At least one approval is required from a designated reviewer
   - Address all review comments and requested changes
   - Re-request review after addressing feedback

3. **Merging**
   - Use "Squash and merge" for feature, bugfix, docs, and refactor branches
   - Use "Merge commit" for hotfix and release branches
   - Ensure the PR is up to date with the base branch before merging
   - Delete the branch after successful merge

## Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors

1. **Keep PRs Focused and Manageable**
   - PRs should address a single concern
   - Large changes should be broken into smaller, logical PRs
   - Aim for PRs under 500 lines of code when possible

2. **Provide Context**
   - Explain the purpose and approach in the PR description
   - Highlight areas that need special attention
   - Document any technical decisions or trade-offs

3. **Respond to Feedback Constructively**
   - Address all comments
   - Be open to suggestions
   - Explain your reasoning when disagreeing

### For Reviewers

1. **Review Thoroughly but Efficiently**
   - Aim to review PRs within 24 hours
   - Focus on correctness, maintainability, and performance
   - Check for adherence to project standards

2. **Be Specific and Constructive**
   - Provide clear, actionable feedback
   - Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
   - Distinguish between required changes and optional improvements

3. **Consider the Big Picture**
   - Evaluate how the changes fit into the overall architecture
   - Consider edge cases and potential issues
   - Look for security vulnerabilities

### Code Review Checklist

- **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Architecture**: Does the design make sense?
- **Complexity**: Is the code as simple as possible?
- **Tests**: Are there appropriate tests?
- **Naming**: Are variables, functions, and classes named clearly?
- **Comments**: Is the code adequately documented?
- **Style**: Does the code follow project conventions?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Accessibility**: Does the code maintain accessibility standards?
- **Reusability**: Could any parts be made more reusable?
- **Error Handling**: Are errors handled appropriately?

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **build**: Changes to the build process or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples

```
feat(visualization): add quantum particle effects

Implement new quantum particle visualization with wave-particle duality effects.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(navigation): prevent crash when switching systems

The navigation system was crashing when rapidly switching between star systems.
This adds proper cleanup of event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

Fixes #57
```

## Git Best Practices

1. **Keep Commits Atomic**
   - Each commit should represent a single logical change
   - Make it easier to understand, review, and revert if necessary

2. **Rebase Feature Branches**
   - Regularly rebase feature branches on the latest develop
   - Resolve conflicts early

3. **Don't Commit Generated Files**
   - Ensure the .gitignore file is properly configured
   - Don't commit build artifacts, dependencies, or local configuration

4. **Protect Sensitive Information**
   - Never commit secrets, credentials, or personal data
   - Use environment variables for configuration

5. **Use Git Hooks**
   - Leverage pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
   - Use pre-push hooks for running tests

## Handling Releases

1. **Create a Release Branch**
   - Branch off from develop: `release/v1.2.0`
   - Update version numbers and documentation

2. **Stabilize the Release**
   - Only bug fixes are allowed in release branches
   - No new features should be added at this stage

3. **Finalize the Release**
   - Merge the release branch into main
   - Tag the release with the version number
   - Merge the release branch back into develop
   - Delete the release branch

## Handling Hotfixes

1. **Create a Hotfix Branch**
   - Branch off from main: `hotfix/v1.2.1-critical-fix`
   - Fix the issue and update version numbers

2. **Review and Test**
   - Ensure thorough testing of the hotfix
   - Get code review approval

3. **Merge the Hotfix**
   - Merge the hotfix branch into main
   - Tag with the updated version number
   - Merge the hotfix branch into develop
   - Delete the hotfix branch

## Conclusion

Following these Git workflow guidelines will help maintain a clean, organized repository and facilitate efficient collaboration among team members. These practices should be followed by all contributors to ensure consistency and quality in the QQ-Verse project.
