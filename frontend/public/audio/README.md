// Audio Transition Effects Placeholder
// 
// These audio files need to be created and placed in the public/audio directory:
// 1. wormhole-enter.mp3 - A subtle "whoosh" sound with increasing pitch for entering a star system
// 2. wormhole-exit.mp3 - A similar "whoosh" sound with decreasing pitch for returning to the hub
//
// The audio should be:
// - 1.5 seconds in duration (matching the transition animation)
// - Spatial/3D audio effect that moves from the center outward (for entering) or inward (for exiting)
// - Contains subtle quantum/digital elements (soft beeps, hums, etc.)
// - Has a soft beginning and end to avoid audio jarring
// 
// Audio volume should be adjustable through user settings, with a default at 70% volume.
